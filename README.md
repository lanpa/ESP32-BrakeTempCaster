# ESP32 Node32S Project

This project is designed for the ESP32 Node32S development board using PlatformIO. It serves as a template for building applications with the ESP32, demonstrating the structure and organization of files and directories.

## Project Structure

```

## Getting Started

1. **Install PlatformIO**: Ensure you have PlatformIO installed in your development environment.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
3. **Open the Project**: Open the project folder in your IDE.
4. **Build the Project**: Use PlatformIO to build the project.
5. **Upload to ESP32**: Connect your Node32S board and upload the firmware.

## Usage

Modify the `src/main.cpp` file to implement your application logic. You can add custom libraries in the `lib` directory and include header files in the `include` directory as needed.
